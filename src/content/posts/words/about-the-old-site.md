Most of the content of the previous site is still available, but I'm not sure most of it is still relevant so I'm not migrating it. I may decide to migrate a couple posts, but just in case someone out there wants a few of my old posts about social media in libraries or that kind of thing, they are still available at [https://kellydallen.wordpress.com](https://kellydallen.wordpress.com).

Aside from the library-related posts, some of the more interesting content at the old site relates to some of my classic DJ mixes that had been posted on the web at various times. That stuff is still available at my [Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/metafakt/).

Some of it is really good still!
