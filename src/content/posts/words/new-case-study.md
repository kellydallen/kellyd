## More On pbc.gov/neighborhood, one of my favorite projects.

As I'm developing and expanding this infosite-slash-portfolio-slash-blog, I'm expanding upon some of the content I rushed up in the early development. I have now rewritten and expanded upon my most recent project with a full case study. In trying to expand on some of my skills, and learning industry standards (not just how we may have done it at past workplaces), I finished a full UI/UX preparation course with Codecademy and decided to rewrite a few of my projects in this manner.

More coming soon, but check that one out [here](/posts/projects/palm-beach-county-neighborhood-app)
