## Hi üëãüèª I‚Äôm **_David_**, also known as **_kelly d_**, an alias that came about primarily in an attempt to be slightly more Google-friendly.

### Things about me:

- I am an always-learning web developer
- I once wrote a personal bio for myself that was configured as a fill-in-the-blank Madlib
- I once had Roxane Gay as a professor, a Creative Writing course in which our primary semester assignment was to write a novel, which I hope to publish someday
- I am a jack-of-all-trades in a career track that often values specialization, but this has enabled me to bring value to any project, no matter the focus
- I like to think of myself as a Swiss Army knife in that I can fill any area of greatest need (which is how I became somewhat front end focused, but also a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none)
- I am a 5th-generation Floridian that recently relocated to Northern Virginia with my wife
- I believe that with an English degree I bring certain skills that can be valuable in tech-centric lines of work
- I take pride in being a _Big Picture‚Ñ¢_ person that skates to where the puck is headed
- I wrote and produced electronic music many years ago, most of which was not so great, but is still a hobby
