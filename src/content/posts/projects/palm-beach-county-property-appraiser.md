## Background

I redesigned the Palm Beach County Property Appraiser site in 2016 which was a massive project between front end design, the Property Appraiser, GIS, and application development teams. This design met with almost universal acclaim so in 2023 when the time came to do a refresh of the site, it was looked at as more of a touch-up modernization rather than a wholesale rebuild.

**Tech**: Bootstrap, Custom CSS/Sass, GIS Mapping, .NET, Javascript/Jquery

## Project

When the 2023 redesign project started I was involved in other projects, so the decision was made to outsource the _template_ design to a third party contractor.

At the point the design was finalized I adapted it to work across the entire site, including with the GIS and application areas.

In addition to the refresh, this time was also a time to make the site completely ADA compliant.
