During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Palm Beach County Community Services department needed a landing page and information portal for rental, utility, food and other kinds of assistance built in a weekend. While it was mostly a portal to applications and other information, I found out about the need on Friday night, and have five different visual options built by the following Monday. The website became a critical resource for the county to disperse assistance to those in need and is still in use today (although I haven't been involved in the graphical design for some time).

Of course, it was mobile-friendly by the following Monday as well.
