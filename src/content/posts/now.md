I love the idea of sharing some of what we're into, doing, enjoying, reading or just want to bring more attention to so I'm going to collect things like that right here. I'm not entirely sure whether this will be entirely transient, or whether I may occasionally save these for archiving.

A brilliant YouTube channel by Frankie.

**Malazan: Book of the Fallen**

I'm about 60% done with the final book (_The Crippled God_) in the core 10-book Malazan series by Steven Erikson. I read the other famous fantasy epic **Wheel of Time** (Robert Jordan) series in 2020, the _year of big projects_ (aka the pandemic). While WoT is longer at 14 books, Malazan is dense, infamously difficult, and wonderful, simultaneously one of the most beautiful, thought-provoking and deeply unsettling things I have ever read.

**The Future Sound of London**

In watching Netflix's latest season of **Black Mirror** I was delighted to hear The Future Sound of London's "We Have Explosive" -- almost 30 years old now -- in the end credits of the Peter Capaldi episode. I had to revisit their back catalog and it still sounds as good today as it did then, possibly better.

**Steven Slate VSX Version 5**

Speaking of music, the latest version of VSX came out this week. This is an audio production app designed for accompanying headphones, which now goes even farther. It uses a series of audio frequency tests to calibrate to your personal ear canal, which is different for everyone. Once this is done, it can impressively simulate the sound of various high-end studios in the custom headphones as if you were listening to, recording, or producing music out of their expensive and carefully tuned speaker systems.

**The Last Epoch**

This is an indie game that takes inspiration from Diablo and Path of Exile, but there's just something I love about the loot and crafting system in this one. It's quite polished and there's something that feels more modern than PoE but less cookie-cutter than Diablo. (I admittedly love both of those too.)
