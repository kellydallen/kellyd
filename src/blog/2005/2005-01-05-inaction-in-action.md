Lack of action on the web and music front obviously.  It's a combination of things for which I half-heartedly apologize with great fervor.

A brief synapsis of life, lack of, and otherwise:

**Work** -

Some may know I did web design for essentialgroove.com for the past couple years.  Well, essential shut down October 1st, 2004.  They had told me they wanted to just shut down the retail store and attempt to continue the internet site.  Co-owner Caroline said she'd call when they were ready to start it up, and over 3 months later I haven't heard a peep.  So consider it done.  For those interested in gory details, the 2 owners were married, and you know how married life goes:  at some point both parties decide they hate each other, decide to divorce, and fight over every aspect of their once-shared lives, especially any aspect that could be shown to have money-making potential.  So EG was partially a victim of marital strife (of which I was not involved, obviously) and partially a victim of total lack of any advertising online at all.  In fact, I believe the actual brick & mortar store was advertised for in exponential amounts greater than the online store, so they were spending some on the 100 people living in South Florida that buy records, while spending nothing to attract an internet (i.e. worldwide) crowd.

The label (Pure) and label group were fought over as well, but I believe it has apparently restarted upon DJ Hardware's self-imposed exile to Houston.  In many ways it has ceased to be a label "group" and mostly just a collection of Pure labels now.  (Pure, Pure Breaks, Pure Limited, etc.)

So I was out of a job.  To continue the story, unemployment denied me. It's a long story, but it's not worth going into.  Let's just say that the Florida Unemployment System, in all its grandeur and honor, is set up to reward those that take advantage of the system with nefarious intent, and punish those who try to avoid unemployment altogether. So here I am let go from essentialgroove.com when it closed, and any music money would have been coming from the temporarily shut-down Pure label group.

About then is when you say, "I better get a fucking real job."

So that's what I did.  And I'm working a lot for now.

Which brings me to....

**Music** -

I have no idea if the latest productions I've finished are officially out or not.  Both have been almost universally praised by every opinion I've heard.  The IIO mix has been described as "new and innovative without sounding too intellectual or odd".  I know Sasha & Chris Fortier both have it (because I sent it to them) but I don't know if they've played it.  I know Chris isn't because it's not quite his sound.  I'm not sure who else has it, has played it, or whatever, but when it comes out, take a listen because it's one of the things I'm most proud of ever.

The official "America" remix is on promo vinyl I believe, but no idea who's playing that either aside from Chris Fortier.  We talked about him using it on an upcoming mix-CD of his, but no word on that.

The un-official "America" remix (the one on this site for download) has also been almost universally applauded and I know it has been played by Kobbe himself, and pretty heavily by Filterheadz amongst others. Cheers mates.

What will the future be with me holding a ("real") job?

This I can't answer right now, but in all likelihood I will release less, but what I will release will take far greater chances.  If I'm making money from a real job, there's no good reason I see to write music for the express reason of making money from it.  Thus, I will write music for myself, with no limits or rules self-enforced, and if others like it, jolly good.  If they don't, no biggie, the income will come from someplace else.

This also means the far likeliest choice of production I will move in the near future is one of non-dance music, unless I get some remix offers damn quick (hint hint).  I have long respected Pete Namlook, Wolfram Spyra, and the whole Fax crew.  I think Ulrich Schnauss is a genius, and love stuff like Zero 7.  So count a real possibility of a future release of a full-CD, very likely self-published on my own label.  Which is made possible by having aforementioned ("real") job.

**Mixes** -

I'm working on a new DJ mix.  Perhaps it'll be my last one ever, or perhaps (with encouragement) I'll continue even with a rough time schedule.  But I'm approaching it like it may be a long time before I do another one, and I'm approaching it with the attitude that I don't care who likes it besides me.  This is how some of the best things are created in my opinion.  I can say I think it's incredible, the bits I've mixed so far, and am concentrating on using things people would never imagine someone playing.  Thick in terms of some of Tom Middleton's mixes (like the one called "The Trip") but mine is actually good throughout (unlike the aforementioned).  \[_sidenote:  Tom Middleton is truly a genius, but "The Trip" was either incredibly ambitious or incredibly stupid - either way, I think it fails in its approach._\]

That's all I have for now.  If something happens that is interesting (besides a tsunami) in the news, I will attempt to comment on it in my brazen, self-centered, entirely narcissistic way.  \[_sidenote redux:  Nothing against tsunamis and their noteworthiness - it's just that I can't say anything more than "bummer" and that's been said far too many times already._\]
