Been a while since I posted so I thought I'd throw up a quick word that the Iio and Kobbe & Nitro remix releases are imminent.  It's unreal to me (but in a good way) that the release getting the most interest and generating the most excitement is the free remix I released on this site just prior to the November elections.

Don't get me wrong - it's probably my favorite as well, but it's nice to see people will show interest in something a bit off the beaten track, if it's done in a creative and somewhat unique way.

Another quick plug for people to add me on their [Myspace.com](http://www.myspace.com/kellydallen) friends list too.  My list isn't "pitiful" anymore, but the more the merrier.

If you've just stumbled upon this site after hearing any of the recent remixes, please [drop me a line](mailto:kellydallen@gmail.com).  I'm not like the average dj or producer.  I almost always answer emails (if they're nice at least), and usually I answer emails with one that is about 3 times as long as the one I got.  I like to hear people's input and ideas, and generally don't talk to many other "pro" (accent on quotations) producers because their ideas are usually based in tradition or some other cliches that I don't adhere to.  (except Austin, Kobbe and some of the other wicked guys I'm always interested in hearing from..)
