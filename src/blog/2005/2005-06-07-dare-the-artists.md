sorry, i don't have a complete tracklisting or cue-sheets or anything because there's a lot of times where i have three songs playing at once, and use just bits and pieces from specific tracks..  the track order is somewhat similar to the order the artists are listed..

if you like the mix and want to keep in touch, add me to your **myspace.com** friend-listing..  here's [my page](http://www.myspace.com/kellydallen)..
