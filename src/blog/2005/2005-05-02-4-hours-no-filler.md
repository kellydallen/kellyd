Currently finishing up a 4 hour (yes, that's not a typo) mix that I'll make available as soon as I'm convinced nothing like it has ever been done before, and anyone listens to it will immediately fall to their knees weeping tears of happiness, possibly dying in the process.  Something like a musical version of 'The Ring' except no creepy little girls (although I have nothing against creepy little girls of course).

More details soon.  It could end up being more than 4 hours.  It will be as long as it needs to be.  The entire first hour is not really dance music, and the entire mix includes things brand new, and things up to 10 years old.  I'll probably release the first 2 hours of it to a few friends soon.
