[More information on artist Chris Fortier](http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj.asp?ID=173)I haven't talked to Chris Fortier in a bit, and I knew he was considering using the 'America' remix on a compilation, but the above link to Resident Advisor seems to confirm it.

Major thanks to Chris - be sure and pick up the CD.Â  According to R.A. it drops in April..
