Jacques, the saucy feline below has come to join me in my new position as web designer for the Palm Beach County Library System.  For those that didn't know or perhaps know me through the music business I've been working for PBCLS for close to two years now, but was just promoted to lead the entire site re-design and re-launch of the library system's website.  Perhaps I'll talk about it a bit here, or perhaps I'll be so frantically busy that I won't be heard from on this blog for another year (as is the trend recently).

Jacques is another story for another time, but is pictured [here](http://www.kellyd.com/2008/05/23/aidez-moi-cet-endroit-est-fou/ "Jacque").
