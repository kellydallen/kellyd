I've been using this [blip.fm](http://blip.fm/kellydallen) service lately.  It's a little like a cross between twitter and internet radio but it becomes increasingly addictive as you make more friends and everything starts integrating.  Highly suggested! Become one of my listeners [here](http://blip.fm/kellydallen). (Which is the same thing as "following" in Twitterspeak or "friending" in other social services.)

I actually play some rare stuff that I no longer even own, but that exist someplace in the internet ether.

Oh, and follow me on twitter [here](http://twitter.com/kellydallen).
