So I hear the entire Pure Music Recordings catalog is now on iTunes. Very cool.

I'm not necessarily suggesting people go back and buy my previous music because much dance music is such a fleeting, transient thing but it's cool to [have stuff on there](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=309676595&s=143441).
