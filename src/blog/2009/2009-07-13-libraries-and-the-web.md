A lot of you guys may know I've been with the Palm Beach County Library System for a while now working on some new technologies for the system. I may occasionally use this blog to discuss some things I've learned that may help others, or may light a new path that some might not have envisioned.

Briefly, the standard disclaimer, my opinions don't necessarily reflect the PBC Library System.

Currently I'm working on a total site redesign using the Drupal CMS which is growing exponentially and is gonna be giant, or at least more giant than it already is. The first library tech post will be relating to Twitter though because it is a bit of a misunderstood technology that enables some techniques that aren't apparent right from the start.
