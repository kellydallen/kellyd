[Adam Singer](http://www.agsinger.com/) and I were recently chatting about a mix I did a while back - we generally agreed that it was probably the best mix I ever released on the net and still sounds good today.

I thought I'd make it available again. I will see if I can dig up a tracklisting for it. It is two hours long and moves from a dreamy and atmospheric beginning to some techy stuff, through the world of house, gets a bit frantic towards the end before settling into a nice smooth final 20 minutes.
