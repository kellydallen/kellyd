Okay, so I've decided to end my long self-imposed DJing exile by doing a set at Underground Nistro in downtown West Palm Beach.  It'll be May 4th, which is a Friday.  This is the Friday of Sunfest and the venue is basically right there in the same area.

It'll be a 100% laptop set.  I am unpredictable and unique.  I may never DJ again, or I may DJ a lot after doing this.  Come help me decide.

I'll post some more details in a day or two.
