From the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3958665.stm):

> The international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites.
>
> Netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney failed.
>
> By contrast Netcraft's four monitoring stations in the US managed to view the site with no problems.

Odd.
