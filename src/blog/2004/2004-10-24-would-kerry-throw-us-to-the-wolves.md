From factcheck.org's new article about the already infamous 'Wolves' ad:

> A new Bush ad claims Kerry supported cuts in intelligence “so deep they would have weakened America ’s defenses” against terrorists, and shows a pack of hungry-looking wolves preparing to attack. Actually, the cut Kerry proposed in 1994 amounted to less than 4 percent, as part of a proposal to cut many programs to reduce the deficit.
>
> And in 1995 Porter Goss, who is now Bush’s CIA Director, co-sponsored an even strong deficit-elimination measure that would have cut CIA personnel by 20 percent over five years. When asked about that at his confirmation hearings he didn't disavow it.

It goes on to say Kerry was supporting regular **increases** in the several years leading up to 9-11.  If the levels of flat-out lying continue, and the American public rewards Bush by re-electing him, why should **any** politician ever need to tell the truth again?  Sure, Kerry occasionally stretches the truth or gives out selective truths to paint a specific picture, but the flat-out lies are all coming from one direction because no one is holding them accountable.
