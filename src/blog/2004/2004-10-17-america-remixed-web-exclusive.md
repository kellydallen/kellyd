So I remixed Kobbe & Nitro's 'America' a little while back with the intention it would be out before the elections.  It's still not out, and I don't know when the label is going to be able to get it out, so I have an \*alternate\* mix for release on the web exclusively.  This is an entirely different mix than will (hopefully) be released on vinyl, but I'm very proud of both.

So grab it while you can.  It's angry and it doesn't hold back.

P.S.  While you're at it, if you're new to my site, you should check out the [most recent dj mixes](http://www.kellydallen.com/kelly_dallen/dj_mixes/index.html) I've done (below) - I don't know how much longer I will be able to keep them up.
