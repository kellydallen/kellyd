[A new study](http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Pres_Election_04/html/new_10_21_04.html#) shows (surprise!) that Bush supporters wrongfully believe things like Saddam was found to have a weapons program or WMD's and that (!!) the rest of the world supports the US in invading Iraq.

> "The roots of the Bush supporters' resistance to information," according to Steven Kull, "very likely lie in the traumatic experience of 9/11 and equally in the near pitch-perfect leadership that President Bush showed in its immediate wake. This appears to have created a powerful bond between Bush and his supporters--and an idealized image of the President that makes it difficult for his supporters to imagine that he could have made incorrect judgments before the war, that world public opinion could be critical of his policies or that the President could hold foreign policy positions that are at odds with his supporters."

How do you convince people that cannot hear truth?Â  It's like saying to someone, "The sky is blue" and they respond, "No, it's lime green because Bush said so."
