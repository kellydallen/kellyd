Adult Swim's newest creation, [Tom Goes to the Mayor](http://www.adultswim.com/shows/tom/index.html), premiered tonight.  In case you missed it this one comes to you from Executive Producer [Bob Odenkirk](http://www.bobanddavid.com), and [Tim & Eric](http://www.timanderic.com) and uses oddly disconcerting, almost unanimated, photocopier-style cutouts as the characters.

The first episode featured Odenkirk himself as a John Walsh-style TV host preaching to keep kids "scared straight" which leads the Mayor to an idea that bear traps placed all around town will be the best way to keep the town's children safe from the horrors that threaten them.

This leads him to enlist the help of the town's two competing bear trap stores, owned by brothers, and played by Jack Black and Kyle Gass.  If you're not watching Adult Swim, you're missing some of the coolest shows on TV.
