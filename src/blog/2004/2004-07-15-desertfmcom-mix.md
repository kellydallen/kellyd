Here's the mix I did for desertfm.com, one that I like quite a bit.  Truly a lot of stuff many or most haven't heard, and it's two full hours, so it really has a lot of development and an interesting ebb and flow.

To grab it, right click [here](http://69.72.189.151/kd/kelly_d_-_desertfm.com_07-14-04.mp3) and select "save as".
