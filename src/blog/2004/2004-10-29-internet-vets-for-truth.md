For the one or two people in the US that still need to be informed that Bush is pretty much a dangerous bozo, the [Internet Vets for Truth](http://www.internetvetsfortruth.org/) give you tons of material as torrents and quicktime movies for consumption.

This is a good central place with a bevy of clips from miscellaneous sources including some from "Going Upriver", Eminem's incredibly wicked "Mosh" video, and Jon Stewart's appearance on Crossfire.Â  The Eminem "Mosh" video is one of the most heavy-hitting, pull-no-punches videos I have seen in a long time, maybe **ever**.
