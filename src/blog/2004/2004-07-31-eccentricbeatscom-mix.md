I did an hour-long mix for Samer from Pangea for him to play on his eccentricbeats.com show. In case you missed it here's a [link for download](http://69.72.189.151/kd/kelly-d_-_eccentricbeats.com.mp3). (Right click and select 'Save As')

I usually put the tracklisting in the ID3 tags (in the 'Comments' field), but in case you want to figure out whether you're interested, here it is:

\- chardronnet - ledge \[raum musik\] - kamueflash & bee - isopanzer \[ringelbeatz\] - adam kroll - squonk \[traum schallplatten\] - switch - getondownz \[freerange\] - guido schneider - as dry as i can \[pokerflat\] - abe duque feat blake baxter - what happened (old school mix) \[abe duque records\] - jackmate - prodigal son \[resopal\] - pascal feos - flashed back (steve bug remix) \[pv\] - britney spears - breathe on me (james holden dub) \[white\] - 2 dollar egg - lebt \[nummer\] - jackmate - manray \[resopal\] - noah pred - converge \[morris audio citysport\] - slam - known pleasures \[soma\] - metaboman - easy woman (robag wruhme remix) \[raum musik\]
