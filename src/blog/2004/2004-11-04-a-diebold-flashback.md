Courtesy of [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net), here's a timely flashback to a [CNN story](http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/30/technology/election_diebold/?cnn=yes) including statements made by Diebold CEO Walden O'Dell:

> The company came under fire last year for a letter that Diebold CEO Walden O'Dell wrote as a fundraising pitch to Republicans. In the letter, O'Dell said he was "committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president." Diebold is based in North Canton, Ohio.
