Meant to post this a couple weeks back but never got around to it. New mix ready for checking. As I usually try to do, no specific genres are adhered to, just music that is good, fits together, and makes sense as part of the big picture. A few of the last mixes have been more listening-inspired mixes - that is to say, dance oriented, but with an effort to be listenable in a non-dance situation. This one is clearly a live-oriented mix, one meant to be a current respresentation of what I'm spinning live, on the rare occasions I get away from production.
