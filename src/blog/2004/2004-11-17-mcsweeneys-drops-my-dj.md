Nobody can get literary on DJ culture like [McSweeney's Internet Tendency](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2004/1/12bieber.html "McSweeney's Internet Tendency: My DJ.").

An excerpt:

> My DJ lays down some real hardcore shit while the doctor tells me the lump on my left testicle is just a benign cyst.
>
> \[....\]
>
> The doctor gives me a little plastic card to hang in my shower that shows me how to check for lumps. _Motherfucker say what_, I mouth to the beat. My DJ encourages the doctor to throw his hands up, but the doctor declines.
