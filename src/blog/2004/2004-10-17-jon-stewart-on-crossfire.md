To briefly expand a little on what I said below:  with this 'America' remix, I am not telling you who to vote for.  I am telling you to be informed about your choice and to decide for yourself.  The media right now is an extended apparatus of both parties, neither of which truly represents the people.  The job of the media used to be to inform and help represent the people but they have become just another part of the two party system.  Jon Stewart stated this so wonderfully in his appearance on Crossfire Friday and his performance is already becoming cult legend.  [Boing Boing has some links](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/10/15/jon_stewarts_crossfi.html) where you can download his Crossfire appearance from the net because it is an important thing to see and understand.
