Is McCain the only Republican with any sense?Â  He has [condemned the current ad](http://go.fark.com/cgi/fark/go.pl?IDLink=1067749&location=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3ffile=/news/archive/2004/08/05/politics1020EDT0544.DTL%26type=printable) that attacks Kerry's war record and has asked the White House to condemn it as well (they declined).

Recently I've wondered something about the way the campaigns are going. From my point of view the Republicans seem to realize nothing they can do will make Bush look good, so their strategy is to make Kerry look as bad as possible, so that people think he could be (gasp) worse than Bush.

I don't like Kerry much, but nothing they can do will make me like him less than Bush.
