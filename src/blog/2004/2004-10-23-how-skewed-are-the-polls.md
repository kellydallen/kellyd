[Bush or Kerry - Are Pollsters Making the Connection? New CEA Survey Finds Consumer Shift to Cellular Phones, New Telephone Technologies Leave Millions out of Polling Process](http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20041022005424&newsLang=en)

Perhaps I missed it because I never pay that much attention to polls anyway, but apparently polls rarely touch cell phone users.  I know that I rarely use anything \*but\* a cellphone, and most other younger people are similar.

Add to this the fact that most younger people I know strongly favor Kerry.  Could this be a big surprise come Nov. 2nd when there was a huge (mostly younger) segment of the population that wasn't touched in polls?
