[William Gibson posted the following quote at his site tonight:](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2004_11_01_archive.asp#109980890559073456)

> "A little patience, and we shall see the reign of witches pass over, their spells dissolve, and the people, recovering their true sight, restore their government to its true principles.
>
> "It is true that in the meantime we are suffering deeply in spirit, and incurring the horrors of a war and long oppressions of enormous public debt.
>
> "If the game runs sometimes against us at home we must have patience till luck turns, and then we shall have an opportunity of winning back the principles we have lost, for this is a game where principles are at stake."
>
> \-- Thomas Jefferson, in a letter of 1798, after the passage of the Sedition Act.
