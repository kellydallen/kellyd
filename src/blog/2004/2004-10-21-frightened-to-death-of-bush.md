[Here's an interesting article](http://www.courier-journal.com/cjextra/editorials/2004/10/20/oped-marlow1020-8060.html) by Marlow W Cook, a former Republican Senator.  The article hits on something I've been saying for quite some time:

> First, let's talk about George Bush's moral standards.
>
> In 2000, to defeat Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — a man who was shot down in Vietnam and imprisoned for over five years — they used Carl Rove's "East Texas special." They started the rumor that he was gay, saying he had spent too much time in the Hanoi Hilton. They said he was crazy. They said his wife was on drugs. Then, to top it off, they spread pictures of his adopted daughter, who was born in Bangladesh and thus dark skinned, to the sons and daughters of the Confederacy in rural South Carolina.

Somehow it seems to me, the more informed you are, the less likely you are to vote for Bush no matter what your party.  Oh, and if you watch Fox, [you're actually less informed the more you watch it](http://www.current.org/news/news0319study.shtml).
