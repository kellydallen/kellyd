For bookings, email [booking@kellydallen.com](mailto:booking@kellydallen.com) ..

In most cases, when considering bookings I'll be more interested in the quality of the event rather than the amount of money you can pay. (In other words, I'm much more interested in playing a very good event for little money rather than a totally crap event for a lot of money.)

If you are interested in the kind of DJ I am, check out the DJ mixes available on this site.Â  In the past months, I've been preparing a computer based set integrating Ableton and/or Native Instrument's Traktor.
