Here's a bit of an interesting quote from today's [AP article](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=615&e=1&u=/nm/20041028/pl_nm/campaign_kerry_dc) about the campaigning.Â  Kerry said:

> "About a year ago, when things weren't going so well in my campaign, somebody called a radio talk show and they said, thinking they were just cutting me right to the quick, they said 'John Kerry won't be the president until the Red Sox win.' Well, we're on our way."
