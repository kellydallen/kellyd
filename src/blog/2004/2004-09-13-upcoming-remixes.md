Finished my remix of Kobbe & Nitro's infamous "America" track a couple weeks back.  We've gotten acetates back, and the final release should be around any day.  In an election year like this, I'm not gonna tell you who to vote for, but I just want to express how important it is to educate yourself on the candidates.  Do so on the internet and other various sources, and don't rely too much on TV news.  See the movie "Orwell Rolls in His Grave" for details on that.

Also just finished my remix of Iio's upcoming "Runaway" release tonight.  No word on if it will be on the main release, or possibly a limited type thing, but I think it's a fantastic mix that pushes the envelope on several levels and makes some more headway in helping define a new/unique sound in dance music.  For such a well-known group like Iio I tried to pay special attention to giving my mix a true "street-cred" attitude - in other words, I feel I didn't try to make it more commercial because of who they are.  In fact, this mix may be less commercially based than most would expect.  I used the full vocal, but if I can find time I may do a dirty dub of it.

Cheers..
