From the [Guerrilla News Network](http://www.gnn.tv/headlines/headline.php?id=140):

> Why did a voting machine in Republican Gahanna, Ohio report 4,258 votes for George W. Bush when only 638 people cast votes at the New Life Church polling site?

If Kerry had been the winner and an irregularity like this were discovered in _his_ favor, all hellfire and brimstone would rain down upon the earth.Â  Does anyone actually think this is just an isolated case?
