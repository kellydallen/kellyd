[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot online for free before releasing it on Nonesuch Records.](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,65688,00.html#)

Almost as if on cue, [Wired News talks with Wilco](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,65688,00.html "'Music Is Not a Loaf of Bread'") about their decision in 2001 to walk away from their then-record label (Reprise) and release the album free on the internet.

Now three years later, they are larger than ever and have a new label that is much more internet friendly and visionary (Nonesuch) than their previous label.

I realize it's not the exact thing I was talking about in my [well-timed dialogue on the changing landscape of the music scene](http://www.kellydallen.com/kelly_dallen/2004/11/gates_vs_jobs_t.html) and my perception that I don't believe Gates or Jobs either fully "get it", but the timing was so perfect that I can't help but point it out.
